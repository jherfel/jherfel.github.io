		<p>Building credit is a tough thing when you do not have any credit history. However even with a bad credit 
		history it can be hard to get your elf out of that hole. Therefore, how do you build good credit that will 
		get you where you need so that you can buy all those things you ever wanted? If you are a person that is just 
		out of high school or have never built any credit you will want to either: </p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Apply for a secure Credit Card</li>
			<li>Apply for a Credit Building Loan</li>
			<li>Get a Co-Signer</li>
			<li>Become an authorized user on someone else's credit card</li>
			<li>Get cedit for the rent you pay</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>With any of these options, you will want to make sure that you are paying your bills on time. Late payments 
		or no payments will not help your credit it will only hurt you. Of the options above the easiest credit 
		building option is the secured credit card. With this you will be able to start building your credit in six 
		months, so long as you pay your bills. What I suggest to people is that you charged you gas to the credit card 
		when you need it, then pay it off at the end of the week. This way you do not forget that you owe the money and 
		use it somewhere else and not have the money to pay your credit card. The second option to easy credit building 
		is a loan, whether that be a personal loan or an auto loan. Again, you will want to make sure that you pay the 
		loan payments on time and in a matter of six months you will start building credit. For a loan you may need a 
		co-signer, if you set the loan constraints low enough it will not be hard to find a co-signer.</p>
